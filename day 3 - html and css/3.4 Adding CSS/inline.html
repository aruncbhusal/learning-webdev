        <!--The style atribute is a global attribute, meaning all tags can have it
        The value here contains a pair of property:value which is the CSS code
        Here we specify the text color to be blue
        Inline CSS is useful when we have to target a single element specifically
        But hard coding each element with inline CSS is too cumbersome and not recommended-->
