<!--HTML follows a structure, which can be different according to the use case
But usually we start with a basic "boilerplate" like the one below-->

<! DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>My Website</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Hello World !< /h1>
    </body>
</html>

<!--First line specifies that we're using HTML5 to let browser know
Then we must enclose the html document with the html tag, its attribute lang is helpful for browsers and accessibility tools to understand the language context
The head tag contains things that a browser needs to see, but not necessarily the user
One of the most important tags in head is the meta tag. Here the tag specifies a charset(character set) that is used in this site, this helps the browser know how to render the text content
The title element contains the title shown in the tab/search results
The body tag contains the actual content of the html that is visible to users
We can press ! then enter into a blank html file in VS Code to get a boilerplate automatically
It contains other meta attributes like viewport as well-->
