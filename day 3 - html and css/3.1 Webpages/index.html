<!--In this lesson, we'll be linking between webpages and going from one page to another
We do so using hyperlinks. The current folder contains the index.html which is the home page
And other webpages(html files) inside the "public" folder. The assets are in assets folder
We need to create a mock of the goal image here-->

<h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
<!--Goal: Add an image of yourself(cat) that links to the about page -->
<a href="./public/about.html">
    <img src="./assets/images/cat.png" alt="me" />
</a>

<hr />
<!--Goal: Add a link to your contact me page here -->
<a href="./public/contact.html">Contact Me!</a>
