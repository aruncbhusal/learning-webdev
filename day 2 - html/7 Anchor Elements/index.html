<!-- The anchor tag(a) is used to create hyperlinks in html
 An a tag alone is nothing different from a p tag, but it has an attribute called href
 when href attribute is given a target url, it makes the anchor element clickable
 href is specific to a(and some other tags) but there are global attributes which can be
 applied to (almost) all tags, such as 'draggable'. These attributes are placed in the opening tag
 
 The task here is to create a list of top 5 favorite websites as per the goal image-->
<h1>My top 5 Favourite Websites</h1>
<!--Another challenge was to make it so the list starts from number 5 rather than from 1
Notice the value given to the attribute is enclosed in double quotes-->
<ol start="5">

        <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">Wait, But Why?</a>
