<!--File path is a path using which we access our files on the computer storage
The file path may be absolute(starting from the root of the file system)
or relative(from the current folder where the path begins/code resides)
We can use ../ to go back a step and ./ to look in the current folder for relative paths-->

<!--The target here is to make sure each animal's image is displayed, which are pulled from
different hierarchy of folders and paths -->
