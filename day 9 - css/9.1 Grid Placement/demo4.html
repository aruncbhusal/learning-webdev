      Grid allows us to do that, but since we don't want to cover the content enreily, we can also set a transparency
      When we use 8-hex color scheme, the last two are for alpha, whose value too is from 00 to ff
      Here the value 80 is used because it is 128 in base 10 i.e. half of ff (255 in base 10)*/
