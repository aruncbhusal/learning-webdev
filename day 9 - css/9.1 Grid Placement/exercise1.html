    Thr rows and columns in a grid are called tracks. Between the tracks, there are grid lines that separate them
    The intersections of these lines create cells, where the grid items can be placed
    The items are what we want to lay out. And they can be laid out in multiple cells or a single one */

    by allocating them a block or blocks, and maintaining the order */
