### Why is there only one subsection for bootstrap?

> Because I did the exact same portion of the course in the python course as well.

> Not only this, but the entire Web Design Portion afterwards has already been covered inside the python course

> The personal project site example was reused as well, but I will make a new one because it is not a goal-based challenge but instead a deliverable-based one.

### What will I do now?

> I will look at the course videos, and review the portion, but I will not attempt the challenges in the portion

> I will instead look at the code I wrote when I was learning python, and infer from my chain of thought that way

### Where are the files?

> The files for bootstrap can be found [here](https://github.com/aruncbhusal/learning-python/tree/main/day-58-web-fundamentals-bootstrap)

> The files for Web Design Theory can be found [here](https://github.com/aruncbhusal/learning-python/tree/main/day-65-web-design-school)
