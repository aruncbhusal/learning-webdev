    /* okay so this is the challenge. The intial setup doesn't have any styling apart from the font family
    It also has a hint that we need to use media query, but I've used these enough to know it's important.
    The final output should look like the goal image, not included in the repo. But what i did is what it inline-size.
    if there's any deviations from course solution, I'll make sure to point it out.*/

    First, I don't set any width for these cards, and they are based on content widths
    Next is I didn't allow for any growing or shrinking, which I can add with just a flex: 1. But then I'd have to add max-width:400 like the course
    The rest is as I did, but instead of using flexbox inside the cards, she simply aligned all text to the center
    I had only used flexbox because text-align center didn't work for the button. */
