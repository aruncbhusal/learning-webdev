<!-- Bootstrap is a CSS Framework, which is just a collection of CSS files we can choose to import into our project
 It contains classes which we can put on our html elements to give them styling, depending on the type of content
 It is a way to speed up our design process, and allow stable and trusted UI into our project
 But since we have to rely on someone else's css, it may limit our available customizability
 Plus, since we're giving style via classes, it may introduce class bloat, html being used not only for semantics but also styling
 There are other frameworks as well, like Foundation, Tailwind, MUI, but Bootstrap is the most popular, and it is open source 
 
 We include bootstrap onto our project through a CDN(Content Delivery Network) link, just like our CSS using local link
 CDNs help deliver the css from a server near the user, for a fast CSs application.
 Bootstrap also has scripts which we can put at the end inside the body tag -->
