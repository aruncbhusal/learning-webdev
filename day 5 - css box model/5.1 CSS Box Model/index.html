<!--The CSS Box Model describes the structure of the HTML elements as individual boxes
These boxes push each other and reside in the document
The boxes can have their width and height set as per our need
They also have different properties like border, padding and margin

1. Border: When a border is set, there appears a line of chosen style outside of the element's box
(It can be made to grow inward but we're not told that yet). The border may have width, style and color
the width property can have 4 values which represent top->right->bottom->left in that order

2. Padding: It represents the space between the element's content and the border. It can also have 4 values representing the 4 directions around the content.

3. Margin: It represents the space outside of the border that is empty space around the element's border.
It which can also be 4 directions.

        <!-- TODOs:
1. Create 3 Boxes using the div element.
2. Set their sizes to 200px heigh by 200px wide.
3. Set different background colors for each of the boxes (I used cadetblue, gold and indianred).
4. Add a paragraph <p> element into the first div and add the following words:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam at sapien porttitor urna elementum lacinia. In
    id magna pulvinar, ultricies lorem id, vehicula elit. Aliquam eu luctus nisl, vitae pellentesque magna. Phasellus
    dolor metus, laoreet ac convallis sit amet, efficitur sed dolor.
5. Set the 1st div to have 20px padding all around with a black 10px border.
6. Fix the style of the <p> element to remove all margins.
Hint: Use the CSS inspector in Chrome.
7. Set the 2nd div to have a 20px border on top and bottom and 10px border left and right. (See goal image)
8. Set the 3rd div to have a 10px border 
9. Set the margins for the divs so that each box corner touches the other. (See the goal image)
