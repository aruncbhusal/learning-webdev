//CHALLENGE: Make this app work by applying what you've learnt.
//1. When new text is written into the input, its state should be saved.
//2. When the add button is pressed, the current data in the input should be
//added to an array.
//3. The <ul> should display all the array items as <li>s

// Solution is in App.js as always

// I think this is all for today. I still have more to do and it's been 3 days but wow it's almost midnight
