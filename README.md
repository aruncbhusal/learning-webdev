# Learning Webdev

**Date Started:** 23/1/2025 or 10/10/2081

This repository consists of the files created while learning Web Development following Angela Yu's Udemy course. Though I have already done a bit of web development here and there—most notably during my 5th semester break—I still need to polish up my skills to master these hard skills by the time I graduate.

## Things I Will Learn in This Course (Roughly)

-   HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   Node.js with Express.js
-   Database with PostgreSQL
-   Front End with React

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   A **folder for each day** of learning. A single day might cover a vast array of topics, or just a few.
-   A `progress.txt` file:
    -   This will be updated daily after completing tasks for the day.
    -   It summarizes what has been done so far on that particular day and helps keep myself accountable.
-   This **README.md** file.
-   Additional content or folders may be added over time as necessary.

### Current Status

-   HTML ✅
-   CSS ⏸️

**Ongoing ▶️ hiatus**
