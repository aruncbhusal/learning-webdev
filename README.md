## Introduction

This repository documents my journey through Web Development. The primary references for this journey were [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and [JavaScript - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced). The journey covers multiple facets of webdev, going from frontend to backend, and touching on some concepts of decentralized applications on the web. Then a deeper dive on JavaScript.
I had some experience with Web Development prior to this, but I decided to embark on this from base level as a test.

### Next Steps

> Larger, more self-contained projects, those that deserve their own repositories

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders for each day of learning. Some days cover multiple modules from the course, some might not cover a single module completely (like the React module which is split to 4 days). The structure follows:

-   A **folder for each day** of learning. A single day might cover a vast array of topics, or just a few. - day 1 - html - ...
    > Some folders are a result of multiple days, they are identified as day X*X+1*...
-   A `progress.txt` file:
    -   This will be updated daily after completing tasks for the day.
    -   It summarizes what has been done so far on that particular day and helps keep myself accountable.
-   This **README.md** file.

## 🏃‍➡️ How To Run

### **Step 1:** Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aruncbhusal/learning-webdev.git
```

### **Step 2:**

#### a. For HTML, CSS and vanilla JS files (day 1-11)

These files can simply be opened on the browser from the project directory. Some files may have multiple associations. The source code can be visited in such cases

#### b. For ExpressJS (day 13-20)

These have node_modules folder inside each project folder (light enough because of low number of dependencies). We can run the project using `npm start`. If not available/outdated, try:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

#### c. For React and DApps (day 20-27)

The node modules folder is too large to include for each instance. Before running the program, ensure you are in the project folder and install before running. From the root git directory (example):

```bash
cd "day 22 - react/22.9 useState hook Timer Challenge"
npm install
npm start
```

> For DApps: follow the markdown files in day 24 and 25 folders as there are multiple steps

#### d. For days after 28

Until day 43 we can simply open the index.html, but for files from that day or later, we need to install the dependencies with `npm i` before running with `npm run build` or dev/prod variants, according to the package.json.
