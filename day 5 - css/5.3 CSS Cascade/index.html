<!--The CSS Cascade is how it got its name
It means that the rules to be applied are the ones that come later (are down in the cascade)
We have four levels of cascading and they all affect the application of css rules
Each of the level has a higher priority than the one above:

1. Position: If there are two or more conflicting css rules for an element, the one that comes last is the one to be applied.

2. Specificity: The more specific the selector that targets an element, the higher the priority.
On the basis of increasing specificity: Element selector -> Class selector -> Attribute selector -> ID Selector
where ID selector is the most specific and will have the highest priority

3. Type: CSS Styles can be applied in many ways, and they can be cascaded in the following order:
(Lowest Priority) External CSS -> Internal CSS -> Inline CSS (Highest Priority)

4. Importance: We can use a !important identifier after a CSS rule to make it the highest priority -->
