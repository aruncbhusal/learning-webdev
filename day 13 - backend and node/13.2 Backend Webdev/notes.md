### Why to learn backend?

Most startups and other websites list "Full Stack" as the position for a web developer. Since

Full Stack = Front-End + Back-End

We need a knowledge of both the front-end (what the user sees) and back-end (what happens behind the scenes)

### What is the backend?

The backend consists of three components:

#### 1. The Server:

This is the machine that serves the requests from the browser. It must be on 24/7 and ready to respond to browser requests.

#### 2. The Application:

This is the logic part of the web app. It is the code on the server which is responsible for crafting responses for the requests.

If the logic cannot handle the request, it sends an error status code eg. 404 error, but if it can, it sends a success status code along with the response.

The response may be a certain value, operation, or some form of data, which we need to store somewhere. When the server is turned off, all data is lost.

But we can ensure persistence of this data by storing it.

#### 3. The Database:

This may be the hard drive of the server, or a cloud location, where the data for the web app is stored permanently,

and operations are performed on the dtata as per the browser's request. The logic makes inferences to the database and it accesses/manipulates data in the database.

### How To Write Backend Code?

In the case of front end, we have fixed options, it's basically HTML, CSS and JavaScript, along with frameworks built on JavaScript like React, Angular, Vue.

But in the case of backend, we can work with basically any language as long as they are able to give a response that can be shown in a browser i.e. HTML.

Some of the most popular backend languages and frameworks are (not in order):

1. JavaScript - Node.JS
2. Java - Spring
3. Ruby - Ruby on Rails
4. C# - ASP.NET
5. PHP - Laravel, Cake
6. Python - Flask, Django

In this course, we will be moving forward with Node.JS because it is by far the most popular backend framework, and we've been learning JS as well.
