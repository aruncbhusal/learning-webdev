Day 0:
- Created the repository
- Edited readme. That's it. Not much done on the first day as I'm tired and sleep deprived. Hopefully with a good night's sleep I will be able to make some actual progress tomorrow.

Day 1:
- Looks like this intro part is similar to the HTML CSS portion taught in the python course, I think the videos are reused as well
- How the internet works, how websites work, how to make the best use of this course
- HTML basics, why it is hypertext, why markup.
- The heading element and the paragraph element.
- Already midnight so will leave HTML unfinished, to continue tomorrow.
