### Difference between a token and a coin
In order to create a coin, we need to create our own blockchain, set up our own exchanges, etc, and need to mine extensively for security.

But a token is created based on some other blockchain, most are based on Ethereum. For tokens, we don't need to spend computational resources.

We can simply create our token by specifying the code for the ledger and transfer mechanisms. Doge is coin, Shiba Inu is a token on Ethereum.

Tokens can be used for payments online, equity over some product or service, or for utility, like the cycles in ICP.

### What I will do:
Since I tried to copy the project and yet the frontend refuses to load with "Could not find a canister id to forward to."

I took a break and then changed the link to "localhost" from "127.0.0.1" and it worked. Oops.
