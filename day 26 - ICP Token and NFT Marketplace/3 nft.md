### What we're doing this time
A NFT(Non Fungible Token) marketplace similar to [Opensea](https://opensea.io/). NFTs are tokens that are completely unique.

In contrast to fungible currency like bank notes, fungible tokes like cryptocurrencies, one NFT is completely different from another.

The OpenSea NFT marketplace lists the NFTs but stores them someplace else. We can see transfers [in this site](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d)

It contains the link to the original URI, which we can view easily, but not own. They are usually stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)

But in our implementation, we will store all minted(created) NFTs on the blockchain itself.

We can create pixel art like the cyberpunks using [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/) which we can then sell on our marketplace.

I think I should commit this now as this project might take me over midnight to complete, but I'll have it in this same folder
