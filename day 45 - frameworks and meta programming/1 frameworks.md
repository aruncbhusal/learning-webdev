## Framework?

We already know about library as a third party package that adds functionality to our JS application, like Lodash, Axios, Babel, etc
But frameworks are also third party packages, but they add functionality as well as some rules which help build JS applications faster and easier. There are many JS libraries, the most popular front end frameworks are:

-   **AngularJS:** uses TypeScript, a superset of JS, has complete functionalities and rules to build applications with JS
-   **VueJS:** uses plain JS, is easier to learn compared to Angular, but has less features as well.
-   **ReactJS(kind of):** React itself is a library and not a framework, but it is a huge library that can be combined with others to form a sort of a framework. It uses JSX (enhanced JS).

### ReactJS

It is a library but it can be considered a pseudo-framework because its ecosystem offers basically everything needed from a framework. It is used to build User Interfaces, but ones that act reactively, i.e. a change in one part of the DOM will affect some other part.
This is an example of **declarative** programming, where we declare the end goals, rather than **imperative programming** like we do with vanilla JS, where we dictate each action.
These frameworks like Angular, Vue, and React use Components in order to build the user interfaces.
