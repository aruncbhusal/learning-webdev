<!--Over the years, different ways have been used to create webpage layouts
Initially web was supposed to be a counterpart of magazines and similar design structures were followed
The pages could be laid out with the help of HTML Tables, by putting content into the cells

The different ways of setting up layout are in respective files in this folder. I didn't write any of them.
I will comment on those I feel the need to, but the rest is given as a part of the lesson.
But this index file is where the challenge is so I'll come back here to edit this one -->
