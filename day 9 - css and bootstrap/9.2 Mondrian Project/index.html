    1. First thing is that she used the flex on the body this time. I had a separate container just for centering
    In last challenge I had it on body but she didn't so this time I changed, but she used body this time. okayyy
    2. She had the width and height property in her container, but the black line didn't appear sticking on the bottom
    This was because I had margin for the blue one instead of border. Fixed that, but we don't actually need the height/width there anyway */
