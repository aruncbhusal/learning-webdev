<!-- For this dice game, the HTML and CSS are written already for us, we just need to use JS to make it work
 The game goes like this: When we refresh, the two dices are thrown and based on the result, whichever "player" has a higher number wins
 And the result is displayed in the heading. It should be pretty simple. Let's make it happen.
 The changes I made to the HTML before beginning: added the script tag and linked to new index.js file, and added placeholder images to img-->
