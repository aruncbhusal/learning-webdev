    <!-- We have multiple ways to add JS to our website, similar to CSS
 We can use it as inline with the onload attribute on our tag, like the one below
 Here we add a script to alert the user once the body has been loaded, but similar to inline CSS, it too creates bloat
 So we defer using it like this
 Notice that we need to insert the script within double quotes, so nay double quotes in our JS might interfere
 The engine will confuse starting of any text in the script with ending of the script so we instead use single quotes for them -->
    <body onload="alert('The website is loaded successfully')">
        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <!-- Another way to add JavaScript to websites is using the script tag. It is a way to add internal JavaScript
     The CSS for a website is palced in the head section before the body because we want to load the styling before we load any content
     That allows for a seamless experience, but we don't want script to be loaded before our elements, because we might want to manipulate them
     And it cannot manipulate elements that do not exist yet. Also the website might load slower if we were to apply the code before content -->
        <script>
            console.log('This was added later');
        </script>
        <!-- Apart from these methods, we can also externally add JavaSript onto our website, using the script tag as well, similar to CSS -->
        <script src="./index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    </body>
