        <!-- A website is a HTML document, and it contains elements. The browser converts these elements into objects
        These objects form the Document Object Model, and the website appears as a tree
        From this DOM, we can use JS to manipulate the objects as we want
        We can use the internal script here to see what happens: -->
        <script>
            console.log(document);
            // This is the full HTML document which contains objects(elements) as its children
            console.log(document.firstElementChild);
            // By using this we take a hold of the first child of the document which is the root of our HTML i.e. HTML tag
            console.log(document.firstElementChild.firstElementChild);
            // This lets us access the first child of the document i.e. the head element
            console.log(document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild);
            // Similarly, this one lets us take a hold of the body element. We can also store it in a variable
            var heading =
                document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.firstElementChild;
            console.log(heading);
            // This is the heading h1 tag which has the text hello. We can also manipulate that text
            heading.innerHTML = 'Something else';
            // Not only that, we can also change something else, like the style of the element
            heading.style.color = 'red';

            // These are the properties of the elements/objects, which we can access with the dot(.) notation
            // We also have methods associated to objects which can be triggered by using method() format
            document.querySelector('input').click();
            // Using this command we can select the "input" element in our DOM (which is the checkbox) and click on it
            // In this way we can manipulate both the attributes and behaviors of the HTML elements using JavaScript.
        </script>
    </body>
