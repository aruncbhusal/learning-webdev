        <!--We can include a script tag and add js between the script tags, but unless it is short, we should not,
    because HTML should contain HTML, it would be messy for us to have to manage everything on the same page
    We can include script here, but it would load before any of the webpage does, so to prevent that, we put it at the end-->
        <script src="./assets/scripts/vendor.js" defer></script>
        <script src="./assets/scripts/mine.js" defer></script>
        <!--We have brought them back up to the head section. We don't want the script to run before the html is loaded,
    but we also don't want to parse through the whole html for the browser to make a request to the server to download the scripts
    We can look at how much time it took to make request and get the file in the performance tab by recording when reloading
    We can use the defer attribute while putting script in head section so that the scripts will only execute once html has loaded
    This helps us make the request earlier and be ready with the scripts faster without actually executing them
    
    We can use another attribute called async which lets the script run right after download is completed
    It can be used when the code in the script doesn't depend on the html elements
    But a quirk in async is that whichever script is available first will run first, meaning the order of script tags doesn't matter
    But in this case, the vendor file will always execute before mine.js
    
    In case of script tags with js inside them, we should always put it at the end because there's nothing to download from the server
    so it can be executed directly at the end with no latency. -->
