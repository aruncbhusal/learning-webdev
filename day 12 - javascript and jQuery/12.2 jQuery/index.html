        For CDD method, we can simply get the link or script tag from https://releases.jquery.com/
        When using CDN, if a user has been to another site using the same CDN to download jQuery, it is cached into user's browser
        and the file doesn't even need to be downloaded, making it super fast
        To use it via CDN, we can simply do what we did with Bootstrap, and place it here  -->
