<!--Apart from the other methods, we can also take help of a framework(like Bootstrap)
These frameworks are not a part of CSS itself, but they are CSS written by other people that we can use
These help to speed up our design process as we don't need to reinvent the wheel
And we can just follow their rules and use their curated design, and adapt on top of it

In the case of Bootstrap, it allows for responsiveness by dividing the screen width into 12 columns
We can set an element to span specified number of columns by just giving it a class col-x where x is the number of columns out of 12
