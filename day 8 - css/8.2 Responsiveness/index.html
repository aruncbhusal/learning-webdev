<!--Responsive Web Design involves making the website "responsive" to changes in screen sizes
A webpage is not meant to be opened on a single resolution only. It may need to be resized for
phones, tablets, laptops, ultrawide screens differently. There are mainly 4 ways to achieve that:

1. Media Query
2. Grid
3. Flexbox
4. Bootstrap (or other framework)

Each link in this page leads to the respective page where each of these methods is applied
I didn't write any of the code, but I will comment anything significant in respective pages-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Responsiveness</title>
        <style>
            a {
                display: block;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Responsiveness Methods</h1>
        <a href="./media-query.html">1. Media Queries</a>
