<!--CSS Selectors
A CSS Code is divided into CSS Rules and Selectors
CSS rules are what to do in terms of styling, but before that, we enclose it with {}
The selector is used to select one or more html components to apply the CSS rules to
Selectors are of many types, I will describe here, examples will be in the css file

1. Element Selector:
Selects all elements of a certain type and applies css to them

2. Class Selector:
An attribute "class" can be used to group together elements of any type
And then the class selector can be used to select all elements with that class

3. ID Selector:
Similar to class selector, an attribute called "id" is used for selection
In this case, the same ID cannot be used in two different HTML elements inside the same document

4. Attribute Selector:
We can combine this with other selectors to select only when a specific attribute is given
Or even only when the attribute has a specific value

5. Universal Selector:
Selects all the elements

The target in this lesson is to fulfill the TODO requirements using whatever we've learnt-->
